## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
This is a simple one page site. I choose to use React because it provided the opportunity to practice using state and conditional rendering, as well as validating a simple form without using a library.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [Simple Form Validation with React Hooks useState and useEffect](https://kitson-broadhurst.medium.com/simple-form-validation-with-react-hooks-usestate-and-useeffect-57620d808cc8) - This article was very helpful in understanding form validation with React Hooks, particularly with the concept of how/why to use useRef.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
