  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process
This is a simple one page site. I choose to use React for this project because it provided the opportunity to practice using state and conditional rendering based on window size, as well as in validating a simple form without using a library. I enjoyed researching and problem-solving how to use React Hooks to responsively render different components based on the user changing the window size.
